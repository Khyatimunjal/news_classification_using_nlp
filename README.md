# Fake News Detection

## Description
This project aims to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The dataset includes labeled news articles, where the fake news is labeled as 0 and genuine news is labeled as 1. The project preprocesses the text data, applies tokenization, stemming, and vectorization, and then uses logistic regression and passive-aggressive classifiers to predict the genuineness of the news articles.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
nltk
pandas
scikit-learn

## Results
The accuracy of the models can be printed after training. The logistic regression and passive-aggressive classifier are evaluated on the test data to check their performance.
